# Morris-Water-Maze


## Description

Morris Water Maze is experimentation that neuroscientists use it to measure the effect of neurocognitive disorders on spatial learning. The Morris Water Maze is mostly used for studying Alzheimer's disease in an issue of hippocampal-dependent learning including the acquisition of spatial memory and long-term spatial memory. Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills. This project focused on creating the virtual reality model by referring to the Morris Water Maze test to validate and improve spatial memory of cell brain. As a result, the model can help for slowing down the risk of Alzheimer’s disease through participation in morris water maze VR version. Memory problems are typically one of the first signs of cognitive impairment related to Alzheimer’s disease. People who got Alzheimer’s disease, they have a symptom which is difficult to find the way or remember familiar places. Alzheimer’s disease is currently ranked as the sixth leading cause of death. Therefore, people are beginning to pay attention to memory training for reducing or slowing down the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The objective of this project is to create the virtual reality model for validating and improving spatial memory of cell brain for slowing down the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. This project focused on creating the virtual reality model by referring to the Morris Water Maze test to validate and improve spatial memory of cell brain. Morris Water Maze for VR version was created by Unity with two VR plugins unto SteamVR and Virtual Reality Tool Kit (VRTK). The VR device that we used is HTC Vive. After finish testing, the system will record the test which consists of the personal information, distance and time in each round into a CSV file. The result is a CSV File which records the data of testing, consist of participant's name, participant’s gender, distance and time.
